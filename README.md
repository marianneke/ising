# Ising Model Statistical Test Implementation

This is an implementation of the paper ["Concentration of Multilinear Functions of the Ising Model with Applications to Network Data"](https://nurture.ai/p/5a328a78-d6ec-46af-b11c-ce81462a13e9) for Nurture.ai's [NIPS implementation challenge](https://nurture.ai/nips-challenge).

The implementation can be found [in this notebook](https://github.com/marianneke/ising/blob/master/NIPS_Ising.ipynb).
